## Black Mirror

A basic winforms application to non-destructively hide a monitor. Simply drag the window to the screen you wish to black out and click the button in the corner. The application will expand to occupy the screen and remove the border. Click it again to stop blocking the window.

For more monitors, simply open additional instances of the application.
